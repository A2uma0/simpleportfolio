If you like it, feel free to give it a ⭐.

## Modifying
If you want your own links/name just edit `index.html` <br>
For effects and colors you can edit the `main.js` or `styles.css` file.

If you want to change the images put them in the `assets/` folder and add them to the array in `main.js` <br>
(If you are using gifs and they don't loop, refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40498474/play-gif-image-in-html-with-infinite-loop))

There also is a commented-out music player, which plays a mp3 file in the background. <br>
If you want to use that, just comment it out and point to your mp3 file.

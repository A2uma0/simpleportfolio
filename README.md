# Simple Portfolio
A simple Portfolio website.

## Notable features
- moving image
- image converted to grayscale for black and white look

Yup, that's about it, as simple as it gets.

## Modifying
If you want your own links/name just edit `index.html` <br>
For effects and colors you can edit the `main.js` or `styles.css` file.

If you want to change the images put them in the `assets/` folder and add them to the array in `main.js`
